- 👋 Hi, I’m @alianwaar73
- 👀 I’m interested in Gen AI-powered applications, given the current hype, DRM management and cross-platform market place for digital content specially video games
    - 🎮 I have some experience with blockchain, NFTs, and digital assets so planning on doing something, given this background, for legally trading digitally purchased games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Gen AI by taking the online course at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/109HbI3@2jeNzCrmSShzOCAt5UMVGp3QlEZwnffD5prYbjKQYgFIqwTksjdNRUU72UkRRxdk5g==/)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on above mentioned interests
- 📫 How to reach me: via [Email](mailto:ali.github.anwaar73@gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am in CS because I only wanted to play video games since childhood! It is the new media, imho, that could trump books and movies soon!
